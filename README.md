Hello

I only really somewhat know C++, so I don't do much regarding writing scripts and stuff.
I'm just skilled enough that I can sometimes find the work of other people and fix it to work for myself.

I don't really have much of a public online presence, but I do watch plenty of anime. 
Here's my account on Anilist: https://anilist.co/user/DarkMatter425/
Do with that knowledge what you please.

That's about it for me. (Unless of course there's anything else you would like to know about me)
